PSHT Token â€“ Blockchain Fitness Reward System

ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The project includes:
Smart Contract (Clarity) deployed on Stacks Testnet/Mainnet
Frontend App (Vite + React + TailwindCSS) for interacting with the token

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Many young people in Indonesia lack motivation to exercise regularly, leading to health issues such as obesity, heart disease, and sedentary lifestyles. The absence of tangible incentives causes people to lose interest in maintaining fitness.

ðŸ’¡ Solution Overview
PSHT is a blockchain-based reward token for healthy activities.
Reward Distribution: Event admins verify participantsâ€™ achievements (e.g., step count, sports event participation) and send PSHT tokens directly to their wallets.
Token Redemption: Users can redeem PSHT tokens for rewards like merchandise, vouchers, or other benefits.
Transparency & Security: All transactions are recorded on-chain, ensuring they cannot be manipulated and providing users with verifiable proof.
